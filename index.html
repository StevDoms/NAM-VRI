            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Recent wildfires, such as the Palisades Wildfire and the San Diego Border Wildfires, highlight the growing 
                threat of wildfires to communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. These fires are driven by a mix of 
                climate change and human activities, making accurate weather data essential for wildfire prevention and response.
            </p>
            
            <p>Since 2007, SDG&E has installed weather stations to improve wildfire mitigation efforts. One key strategy is 
                <strong>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)</strong>—temporary power shutoffs during extreme weather conditions 
                to reduce fire risk. The decision to implement PSPS is based on weather station data, particularly wind speeds. 
                Each weather station is linked to a <strong>VRI polygon</strong>, an area where the station's readings are assumed 
                to represent local wind conditions. However, in larger VRI polygons, wind speeds can vary significantly, reducing 
                the accuracy of these readings.
            </p>
            
            <p>Our project focuses on improving wind speed accuracy by identifying areas where 
                <strong>wind speed measurements differ significantly</strong> between local weather stations and the 
                <strong>North American Mesoscale (NAM) model</strong>, a weather forecasting tool. Large discrepancies between 
                these datasets could indicate regions where wind speed estimates are unreliable, affecting PSPS decisions.
            </p>

            <p>To address this, we use machine learning <strong>(LightGBM)</strong> to estimate wind speed discrepancies and 
                refine VRI polygon boundaries. By doing so, we can improve the accuracy of wildfire risk assessments and help 
                ensure PSPS is only implemented when truly necessary.
            </p>

            <p>By improving the accuracy of wind speed data and redefining VRI polygons, our project provides a 
                <strong>data-driven approach to wildfire mitigation</strong>, helping utilities like SDG&E make better-informed 
                decisions about PSPS events and reducing risks for communities in wildfire-prone areas.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>Our methodology consists of several steps to collect, process, and analyze wind speed data, identify discrepancies, and ensure the project is reproducible.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We gathered wind speed data from the <strong>North American Mesoscale (NAM) model</strong> by scraping SDG&E’s data repository. 
                Weather station data is recorded daily, whereas NAM data is recorded hourly. To ensure comparability, we calculated 
                the <strong>daily average wind speed</strong> from the NAM dataset. Additionally, we focused on dates when PSPS was under 
                consideration, totaling <strong>179 unique dates</strong> between 2012 and 2024.</p>

            <p>Beyond wind speed data, we also collected <strong>elevation data</strong> for all weather station and NAM points. 
                This was accomplished by using the <strong>Open-Elevation API</strong>, which provided elevation values based on 
                the latitude and longitude of each point.</p>

            <p>Since the NAM dataset covers the entire United States, we filtered the data to focus on SDG&E’s operational area. 
                This was achieved by obtaining <strong>shapefiles</strong> for <strong>San Diego County and Southern Orange County</strong>, 
                ensuring that only relevant geographic data was analyzed.</p>

            <h3>Data Processing</h3>
            <p>To prepare our data for analysis, we merged multiple datasets, ensuring that only relevant columns were included. This process involved combining weather station data, weather station wind speeds, NAM data, and VRI polygons to create a dataset containing only NAM points within VRI polygons. Additionally, we calculated the Haversine distance from each NAM point to its respective weather station, which serves as a key variable in our model. We also computed the absolute error between the wind speed observed by each NAM point and its corresponding weather station.</p>

            <h3>Predicting Error Outside VRI Polygon</h3>  
            <p>To estimate wind speed error in areas without weather stations, we trained a LightGBM model using NAM wind speed, NAM elevation, nearest weather station elevation, distance to the nearest station, month, and day of the year as features. The target variable is the absolute wind speed error. Since NAM points outside the VRI polygons lack direct station data, we assigned them values from the nearest weather station, assuming similar wind conditions.</p>  
            <p>Using a model rather than directly applying the nearest station’s wind speed allows us to account for spatial and environmental variations, especially in complex terrains. The inclusion of temporal features (month and day of year) helps capture seasonal and diurnal wind patterns, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability to regions without direct weather station measurements.</p>
